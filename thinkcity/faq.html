<section id="faqs-general">
    <div class="container">

        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="main-heading heading-underline">General</h1>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">What's the application process to ThinkCity?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Once you’ve submitted the application form on our website, you will receive a mail with few additional questions about your expectations and technical skills. From this point, we will schedule an interview (Skype or on-site) after which we will tell you very quickly if you get on board. We also recommend you start working on the Javascript track on CodeCademy as soon as possible (even before the interview). We'll ask you to finish this track.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">I’m really a beginner, is it the right program for me?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">We expect 3 things from our students: be motivated (very motivated), be curious, be social.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">How long does the preparatory work takes?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">You must complete the Javascript track on CodeCademy. It should take you about 10 hours to complete.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">What will I be able to build at the end of 12 weeks?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">You’ll have a Ruby on Rails junior developer level. This means you’ll be able to quickly prototype your ideas by creating a web application on your own. For instance, you will know how to include authentification to your site (simple signin/signup, or Facebook/Twitter connect), add an admin back-office, include payment features, automate emails sending, and much more. You’ll also know how to quickly deploy in production and you will have learnt the programming best practices used by top-level startups. You’ll then be facing a choice: continue your entrepreneurial project or become a junior developer in a startup or a bigger tech company.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">Will I learn to create mobile apps?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Yes and no. Let’s be clear, you’ll not learn iOS, Android or Windows Phone development. We really think these skills cannot be taught (honestly) in 12 weeks. We prefer teaching you the basics of programming and web development for many reasons. First, these are the core skills of a software engineer, even if you want to dive into mobile development later on. Second, the web is THE open platform you need to understand. Thanks to Responsive Web Design (which is part of the program), you’ll be able to create apps that will display nicely on mobile devices. You’ll also learn to create APIs that will be used by your mobile apps. It will then be very easy for any mobile developer to code your iOS or Android interface starting from the API you’ve built.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">Can I work and take the course at the same time?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Considering the immersive nature of this program, you want to be 100% dedicated to it. So, plan in advance to make sure you can set work and other responsibilities apart during the 12 weeks. However, if you must continue with your job you can take our part-time immersive course (which offers the same thing as immersive full-time but have a longer tenure) or attend workshops to upgrade your skills.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">What level of programming is required to start?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">To successfully attend the program you need to be familiar with coding fundamentals, and have a basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. If you start from zero don;t worry though, just let us know during the application process: we'll offer you an intro to coding that can be done from anywhere, and quickly prepares you for the admission challenge.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">I already know how to code, would it make sense to apply?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Yes. This program gives you a great opportunity to understand advanced JavaScript concepts, master top JS frameworks, learn industry's best practies, and advance your career to the next step.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">Do I need my own laptop?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Yes, you do. On Mac and Linux it's easier to install some of the software we sue throughout the curriculum, but Windows is fine too.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">Is the course only in English?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Yes, our classes are completely international. Students come from several different countries (on our remote program), and end up working wherever their passion leads them in the world. Also keep in mind that most coding documentation online is in English, so understanding the language is indispensable to be able to properly work in this field.</p>
        <h2 class="main-heading-2">What level of English is required to participate?</h2>
        <p class="main-paragraph">You need to be able to understand when someone speaks in English, and express yourself well enough so that people around you know what you mean. As a rule of thumb, if you can watch a movie in English without subtitles and follow along you should be able to attend the course.</p>
        <h2 class="main-heading-2">Can’t I learn all this online by myself?</h2>
        <p class="main-paragraph">Yes, and no. You could possibly learn the theory by yourself, if you’re extremely clever and crazy stubborn, although it would likely take you much longer. But the truth is that without great support normally people get stuck along the way and lose motivation, eventually giving up. Apart from this, even if you’re the exception to the rule, you would certainly miss the incredible added value of an amazing alumni community, combined with great hiring partners.</p>
        <h2 class="main-heading-2">Why is ThinkCity's graduates hiring rate so high?</h2>
        <p class="main-paragraph">The tech sector is thriving with job opportunities, we select our students very well, train them in the best possible way, and get them in touch with top companies that are looking to expand their teams. In one sentence: we take outcomes very seriously. Also, we have the highest standard in the industry: many institutions don’t specifiy how they calculate their graduates’ hiring rate, and their stats include jobs that are not related to coding. ThinkCity is completely transparent about this.</p>
        <h2 class="main-heading-2">Can I come to visit the campus?</h2>
        <p class="main-paragraph">Sure, we regularly organize visits for prospective students, and love to meet in person. Just contact us by email or WhatsApp / Messenger, so we can schedule an appointment. By the way, another great way to see the campus is to attend our events.</p>

<!--FAQS-APPLICATION-->

<section id="faqs-application">
    <div class="container">

        <div class="row">

            <h1 class="main-heading heading-underline">Application</h1>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">When does your next course start?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Our courses start every 7 weeks, so the next one is behind the corner. If you’re aiming for a specific start date, we recommend submitting your application as soon as possible, because classes can fill up months in advance. We’ll do our best to accommodate your needs.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">Does applying to the course grant me a spot?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">No, applying to the course starts the interview process, which can lead to the admission challenge if you seem a good candidate. Only if you pass the admission challenge you’re admitted to the course.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">What percentage of applicants do you accept?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">We select the most promising candidates for each cohort, considering that the class size is about 20 students. Usually around 5% of total applicants are accepted into the program, although this number can further decrease in moment of exceptional high demand.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">What do you look for in an applicant?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">There are two sides to this answer. From a technical point of view, you need to have basic programming knowledge and speak English fluently. On the other hand, as far as personal traits go we look for students who are extremely passionate, friendly, brilliant, and good at working in team.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">How does the application process work?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">It’s divided in 3 steps. When we receive your application, we contact you to set up a first interview and introductory chat. The purpose of this call is to answer any questions you have about ThinkCity, understand your background, and estimate how well you’d fit with the course environment.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Then, if we both decide to go further, a technical interview with instructors follows. Here we test your programming knowledge, and see how quickly you absorb new concepts. Finally, if you pass these first two steps, we give you a coding assignment to be completed within a couple of weeks, and review the result together. If you fail the second or third step, but we can see that you worked hard, we can give you a chance to train more and try again in a few weeks.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">What’s the best way to prepare for the interview?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Reading this FAQ section is a good starting point. On the coding side, take the following free courses on Codeacademy: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then go through this jQuery tutorial.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Once you’re done, test your coding skills with the Coderbyte JS challenges, and review theory topics reading Eloquent JavaScript chapters 1 to 4. If the above looks too easy for your current programming level, start digging into Super Hero JS.</p>
            <h2 class="main-heading-2">Can I apply from outside Pakistan?</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Yes, ThinkCity is very international, and we have students applying from all over the world! Typically people who join our program from outside Europe are granted a 6 months Schengen visa. We assist you with the process, and do our best to help you figure everything out.</p>

                <h2 class="main-heading-2">Do you offer any scholarships or bonuses?</h2>
                <p class="main-paragraph">Both. On one side, we’re proud to support women in tech offering them a 10% discount to reduce the industry gender gap. On the other side, for each friend you bring that is accepted into the course you get a 10% bonus on tuition cost, that can be deducted from the total or shared with your friend.</p>
                <h2 class="main-heading-2">What is the average salary for a programmer after the course?</h2>
                <p class="main-paragraph">Precise numbers can vary depending on specific job offers. In general, the yearly average enrty level compensation for a full-time developer who completes ThinkCity is between Rs. 50-110 k depending on skills and passion.</p>
